# CasaSurfaceProject
The purpose of this project is to enable housekeepers to log their activity on a Microsoft Surface in real time. This includes time in and time out of cleaning a room, pending maintenance requests, pending bed inspections, and indicating that the room is ready for inspection once the room has been cleaned.    
The Program will be written in C# and will interface with the Casablanca's database (sql). 
The IDE being used will be Microsoft Visual studio.
