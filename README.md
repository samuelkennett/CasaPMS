# CasaPMS
The purpose of this project is to enable housekeepers to log their activity on a Microsoft Surface in real time. This includes time in and time out of cleaning a room, pending maintenance requests, pending bed inspections, and indicating that the room is ready for inspection once the room has been cleaned.
